# 🍎🍌🍊 Fruit Image Classifier

This project is a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model that classifies fruits (Apple, Banana, Orange).  
It is built using **TensorFlow/Keras** and trained on a small dataset.

## 🚀 Features
- Classifies fruit images into categories: Apple, Banana, Orange
- CNN architecture with convolution + pooling + dense layers
- Uses Image Augmentation for better accuracy
- Training & prediction scripts included
